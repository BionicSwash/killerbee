#summary Help for getting started with KillerBee.

= Introduction =

!KillerBee provides an interface for experimenting with the security of !ZigBee and IEEE 802.15.4 networks.

= Install =
You can get the most recent source code from the SVN repository. Releases are in /tags/ and current development (may have issues) is in /trunk/. Also, tar archives of releases are available on the downloads page. Follow the README in the main directory for installation guidance.

= Supported Hardware =
We aim to keep adding support for more hardware. We have recently added a device "driver" model to make this easier. If you would like to help or have a suggestion of hardware to be supported, please contact us.
