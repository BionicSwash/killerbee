#summary KillerBee zbstumbler Tool for identifying networks.

= Introduction =
tools/zbstumbler is a simple script that transmits beacon request frames to the broadcast address while
channel hopping to identify ZC/ZR (Coordinator and Router) devices. It depends on these devices responding to the beacon request frame while it's on the channel. Different interfaces for !KillerBee may turn around 

= Usage =
zbstumbler [-i devnumstring] [-s per-channel delay] [-c channel] [-w report.csv]

{{{
$ sudo zbstumbler
}}}
Or define an interface. Sudo is only needed if root permissions are needed to access the interface.
{{{
$ zbstumbler -i /dev/ttyUSB0
}}}

_Note: it's best to provide an interface using -i, if you know which one you want to use._

= Output =

Example output for a computer with each type of currently supported device attached.
