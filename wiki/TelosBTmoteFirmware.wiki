#summary Compiling and loading the firmware for TelosB/Tmote Sky devices.
#labels Phase-Deploy,Phase-Implementation

= Introduction =
The firmware used is from the GoodFET project, compiled for the telosb platform and with ccspi radio functionality included.

= Loading Precompiled (!KillerBee repository) Firmware Image =
This method is *highly suggested* to avoid dependency requirements. _Note, however, that this firmware may become out-of-date and require updates._

*TODO*

= Compiling Firmware Image =
*Note:*
 * This step is *not neccesssary* if you use the pre-compiled GoodFET firmware included in the killerbee/firmware directory.
 * Compiling the firmware yourself requires the GoodFET SVN project and the msp430-gcc compiler to be installed on your system. It is tested with msp430-gcc-4.4.5.

_Within goodfet/trunk/firmware, run:_

export platform=telosb

export mcu=msp430x1611

export config='monitor ccspi spi'

make clean install

_If this fails on goodfet.bsl command not found, simply run:_
 * ../client/goodfet.bsl --speed=38400 -e -p goodfet.hex

= Verify Firmware Success =
_Within goodfet/trunk/client, run:_
