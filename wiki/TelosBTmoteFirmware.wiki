#summary Compiling and loading the firmware for TelosB/Tmote Sky devices.
#labels Phase-Deploy,Phase-Implementation

= Introduction =
The firmware used is from the GoodFET project, compiled for the telosb platform and with ccspi radio functionality included.

= Loading Precompiled (!KillerBee repository) Firmware Image =
This method is *highly suggested* to avoid dependency requirements. _Note, however, that this firmware may become out-of-date and require updates._

_Within killerbee/firmware, run:_
 * ./goodfet.bsl --telosb -e -p gf-telosb-001.hex

= Compiling Firmware Image =
*Note:*
 * This step is *not necessary* if you use the pre-compiled GoodFET firmware included in the killerbee/firmware directory.
 * Compiling the firmware yourself requires the GoodFET SVN project and the msp430-gcc compiler and related dependencies to be installed on your system.
 * Tested at GoodFET rev. 1131, it no longer builds with msp430-gcc-4.4.5 as the build scripts have been changed to support the new msp430-gcc which is not backwards compatible. Thus:
 * This requires msp430-gcc version 4.5.3. On Ubuntu 11.10, this can be installed via apt-get. Verify msp430-gcc version if you have issues.

_Within goodfet/trunk/firmware, run:_

platform=telosb make clean install

_If make fails on goodfet.bsl command not found, simply run:_
 * ../client/goodfet.bsl --speed=38400 -e -p goodfet.hex

= Verify Firmware Success =
_Within goodfet/trunk/client, run:_
