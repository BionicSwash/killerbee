#summary Running KillerBee under BackTrack Linux
#labels Phase-Deploy

= Introduction =

Some users may want to run !KillerBee on !BackTrack Linux distributions. We offer some specific notes here.

= !BackTrack 5.2 =

!KillerBee 1.0 comes installed by default. We strongly suggest updating to the trunk version or a newer release from this site.

When installing an updated version, note:
 * Download newer release and untar or SVN checkout to a location of your choice
 * Run rm -r /usr/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/killerbee to remove the !KillerBee 1.0 libraries
 * cd into the new !KillerBee download, and in the directory containing setup.py, run:
 * sudo python setup.py install
 * Test installation by running sudo zbid and other tools

= !BackTrack 5.1 and earlier =

No special installation notes.
